## Immunity Debugger for Exploit Devs

Immunity Debugger is the go to debugger for most security professionals. Immunity Inc describes it as a powerful new way to write exploits, analyze malware, and reverse engineer binary files. It builds on a solid user interface with function graphing, the industry's first heap analysis tool built specifically for heap creation, and a large and well supported Python API for easy extensibility.
