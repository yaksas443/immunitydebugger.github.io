## Immunity Debugger for Exploit Devs

Immunity Debugger is powerful when it comes to writing exploits, analyzing malware and reverse engineering binary files. It is the debugger of choice for most security professionals. It has a rich user interface with function graphing and a heap analysis tool built specifically for heap creation. It is shipped with Python API for easy extensibility.

This course covers Immunity Debugger in and out. You will learn both, well-known and lesser-known, features. A few topics taught in this course are as follows:

    Download and Installation
    Views
    Stack Operations
    Disassembler Operations
    Breakpoints, stepping through, tracing etc.
    PyCommands and Mona Library
    Just-in-time debugging
    ... and a lot more

Immunity Debugger is extremly useful while creating exploits, backdooring PE files, encoding binaries to evade anti-malware software. Therefore, a good understanding of this tool is must for security professionals, specially for people studying for security certifications from Offensive Security (OSCP, OSCE, OSED etc.), eLearnSecurity (ePTP, ePTX etc.) and various other organizations.

I have created this course with the vision that it becomes your go to reference guide for Immunity Debugger and other similar debuggers (Ollydbg, Evans debugger etc). 

This is a FREE course and you can [enrol here](https://courses.yaksas.in/p/immunity-debugger-for-exploit-devs-ycsc-lab-essentials).
